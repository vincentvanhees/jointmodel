# jointmodel
Code developed as a student in 2002.

This is a 2D model of the spiral shape of a joint surfaces and the impact this has on the range of motion.
I have included draft_version_project_report.pdf which is a draft version of the project report I wrote in 2002 and that was still in my back-up drive. It describes the ideas behind the model.
