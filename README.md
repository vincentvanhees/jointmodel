# jointmodel
Code developed as a student Bewegingstechnologie (The Hague) in 2002.

This is a 2D model of the spiral shape of joint surfaces and the impact it has on the range of motion.
I have included draft_version_project_report.pdf which is a draft version of the project report (in Dutch) I wrote in 2002 and that was still in my back-up drive.

The code you find in this repository is the code I had on my back-up drive, unfortunately with object names in Dutch. Also, I do not know whether the version of the code matches the model incorporated in the .exe file.
