# jointmodel
Code developed in 2002 as part of a student project for the degree Bewegingstechnologie at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.

This is a 2D model of the spiral shape of joint surfaces and the impact it has on the range of motion.

The files you find in this repository are what I found on my back-up drive:
- File draft_version_project_report.pdf seems to be a draft version of the project report (in Dutch)
- Code unfortunately has object names in Dutch.
- I do not know whether the code version matches the model incorporated in the .exe file.
